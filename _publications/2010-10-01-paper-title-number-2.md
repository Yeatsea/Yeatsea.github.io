excerpt: 'This study aims to summarize the methods and contexts of elicitation of willingness-to-pay per quality-adjusted life year (WTPQ) in the general population and to investigate the heterogeneity of WTPQ estimates.33 studies with 102 WTPQ estimates were included. The overall mean and median WTPQ estimates are $1,280,002 and $44,072, respectively. The meta-regressions demonstrated that types of health gain (quality of life or life length) and certainty of health outcomes are statistically significant factors. Furthermore, compared with online interviews, face-to-face interviews tend to yield lower WTPQ. Moreover, the declining trend of QALY gains and positive effect with statistical significance of the sample age were also noticed..'
