excerpt: 'The aim of this study was to estimate the populationâ€™s willingness to pay (WTP) for an additional quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) in China. The average WTP/Q for the entire sample is 113,120 Renminbi (RMB) (USD 16,884), which is 1.75 times the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. For the quality-of-life improvement scenarios, the mean WTP/Q is RMB 78,907 (USD 11,777, 1.22 times GDP per capita), which is significantly lower than the life extension scenarios (RMB 177,761, USD 26,531, 2.76 times GDP per capita).
